# 🎯 Accurate Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Using MRI Images

This project aims to develop an accurate and automated system for segmenting brain tumors using multimodal MRI images. Leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques, we segment tumors into different regions for better diagnosis and treatment planning.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Accurately segment brain tumor sub-regions using MRI images (e.g., whole tumor, tumor core, and enhancing tumor).
- Use multimodal MRI data including T1, T1c, T2, and FLAIR.
- Implement and evaluate machine learning/deep learning models for segmentation.
- Deploy the model using a Flask web application or mobile interface (optional).
